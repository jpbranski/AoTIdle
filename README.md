# Aegis of Terra Idle

Welcome to AoT Idle, an incremental idle resource management game made using React, Node, and Express. The purpose of this game is to level your skills, upgrade your equipment, and eventually be able to take on the world!  

In this game you will gather resources which you then can use in artisan skills. Each skill goes up to level 100, how many will you max out? Combat, Farming, and other areas will be revealed in upcoming alpha and beta releases to allow you to delve even further into the realm of Aegis of Terra Idle.
